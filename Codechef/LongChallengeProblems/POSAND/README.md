# QUESTION :-
A permutation p1,p2...pN of {1,2,...,N} is beautiful if pi&pi+1 is greater than 0 for every 1≤i<N . You are given an integer N, 
and your task is toconstruct a beautiful permutation of length N or determine that it's impossible.

Note that a&b denotes the bitwise AND of a and b.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. Each testcase contains a single line of input, an integer N.

Output:
For each test case output −1 if there is no suitable permutation of length N, 
otherwise output N integers in a single line which form a beautiful permutation. If there are multiple answers output any of them.

Constraints
1≤N≤105
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106
