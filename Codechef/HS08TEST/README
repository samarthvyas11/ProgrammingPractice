# APPROACH
step-1
   we have to check that whether the withdrawing money is divisble by 5 or not.
step-2
    If step-1 is true check whether withdrawing money adding with bank charges is less then the initial bank balance or not 
              if it is then output is (initial_bank_balance - withdrawing_money - bank_Charges ) else output is initial_bank_balance.
    If step-1 is false then output is current bank balance
