# APPROACH:-
  Step-1 Check whether the number whose factorial we want is zero or one,,if it is zero then fact_of_number is 0 and if it is one fact_of_number is 1.
  Step-2  If step-1 is true then move to the remaining_test_cases ,,and if it is false then initialize fact_of_number to be one and start multiplying it with 2 to number (fact_of_number*2*3*4....*number)
         Print fact_of_number on console
